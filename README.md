INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this application is to create a recipe app in order to demonstrate my knowledge of Ruby on Rails. It will be somewhat simple, because I am to only spend 2 weeks creating it.

In order to keep it streamlined, I am writing down a few requirements.

There will be an user login.

Things you may want to cover:

-   Ruby version

-   System dependencies

-   Configuration

-   Database creation

-   Database initialization

-   How to run the test suite

-   Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

-   Deployment instructions

-   ...
